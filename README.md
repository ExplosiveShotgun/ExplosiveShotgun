# Hi.

I bet you're wondering who I am right now.
I don't know. Does it matter?
My name is Joseph. I'm a freelance coder (which means I have zero actual qualifications) who makes various... things. I'm also an advocate for trans rights, which also happen to be my rights, and I'm working a few things to make our lives hopefully a bit easier.

If you're wondering how you got here. You probably clicked a link that brought you here. If you found that link somewhere, then I probably either made it or helped make it. So you're welcome, I suppose.
If you liked the thing you came from a lot, maybe you could buy me a coffee or leave a positive review or something. You can give me money so I can buy more crap on Steam here: ```oops! someone hasn't actually added a link yet (⊙.☉)7```

Anyways. ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ

### Boring stuff
#### Actually, I'm here to report a bug.
I see. If you found a bug in something I made, you can report it on the project's GitHub. I think. Hopefully anything I put out is properly bugtested and not have any crippling issues. Please keep in mind that I don't have time to work on these things 24/7, so it might take some time for a bug to get fixed. Anything major should get fixed pretty quickly though.

If something I made is down/not working, check the update page first before reporting it as a bug. It might just be routine maintenance.

#### You used something I made and I don't like that.
Oops. Most of the stuff I use should be free to use, but if I used something that you made and you want it removed, we can discuss it.
