# Hi there.
Welcome to my underground lair.

### Who the heck are you?
My name is Joseph Anderson.
I live in Paris, France, and was born in Boston, MA.
Coding is sort of my hobby, I pretty much just write stuff™ that probably isn't very useful but I find fun, or it just pops into my head one day.

### Ok...?
Oh! I know. You definitively want to know my qualifications, right?

...right?

Anyways, I have none!
I code about as well as that one tuple that sits in your blog's backend that you don't use because you never ended up needing it.
Hopefully, your tuples have some knowledge of python and html.
Thankfully, that isn't really a major issue. In fact:

> fools are protected by more capable fools.

I'm reasonably sure I'm a capable fool.

#### What about the miscellaneous stuff no one actually cares about?

- Favorite IDE: PyCharm community, by JetBrains.
- Favorite font: JetBrains Mono, also by JetBrains.

- Stance on the oxford comma: Absolutely, completely and unquestionably necessary *depending on the context.*
- Stance on whatever argument the loves or the haters of the oxford comma are dredging up right now: I really *don't care.*
